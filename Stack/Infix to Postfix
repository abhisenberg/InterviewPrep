Convert the below expression to Postfix expression (manual method):
(A + B ^ C ) * D + E

Step 1 :
Expression Wrapped in Round Bracket Should be Evaluated Firstly.
Again Bracket Contain Two Operators – Addition(+) and Raise to(^) .
Out of these two ‘^’ Operator has Higher Priority.
So “B^C” should be Evaluated First
(A + B ^ C ) * D + E
= (A + B C ^ ) * D + E    [B^C Converted Into BC^]
Now [ B C ^ ] is Converted Expression So Consider it as X
= (A + X ) * D + E    [X = BC^]

Step 2 :
Evaluate A + X
(A + X ) * D + E
= (A X + ) * D + E    [A+X Converted Into AX+]
Now [ A X + ] is Converted Expression So Consider it as Y
= Y * D + E    [Y = AX+]

Step 3 :
Evaluate Y * D
Y * D + E
= Y D * + E    [Y*D Converted Into YD*]
Now [Y D * ] is Converted Expression So Consider it as Z
= Z + E    [Z = YD*]

Step 4 :
Evaluate Z + E
Z + E
= Z E +    [Z+E Converted Into ZE+]
Final Postfix Expression : 
= Z E +    
= Y D * E +          [Put Value of Z]
= A X + D * E +      [Put Value of Y]
= A B C ^ + D * E +  [Put Value of X]
