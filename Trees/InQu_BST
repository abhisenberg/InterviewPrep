****Transform a BST to greater sum tree: Given a BST, transform it into greater sum 	tree where each node contains sum of all nodes greater than that node.
	-> Recur the tree in reverse inorder fashion, means right -> root -> left
		bcz the right node is > than the root, and while backtracking, keep
		adding the value of the right node to "sum" and add it to the current node.
		
	-> the recursion will look like
		func(Node root, int* sum){
			..
			func(root.right, sum)
			
			root.data = *sum;
			*sum += root.data
			
			func(root.left, sum)
			
			..
		}
