***Find if there is a subarray with 0 sum: Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.

	Input: {4, 2, -3, 1, 6}
	Output: true 
	There is a subarray with zero sum from index 1 to 3.
	
	-> FInd the prefix sum of the array, if the prefix sum repeats at any point,
	then it means that there exists a subarray between those pts with 0 sum.
	ex- 
			arr[] = {1, 4, -2, -2, 5, -4, 3}

		If we consider all prefix sums, we can
		notice that there is a subarray with 0
		sum when :
		1) Either a prefix sum repeats or
		2) Or prefix sum becomes 0.

		Prefix sums for above array are:
		1, 5, 3, 1, 6, 2, 5

		Since prefix sum 1 repeats, we have a subarray
		with 0 sum.
